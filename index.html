				<em>Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Advocate role?</em>
			</div>

			<br>

			<p>
				I'm a problem solver with a knack for reading people. My friends and colleagues know me to be calm in the face of chaos. I rise to the occasion and keep a cool head when most are losing theirs.
				<br><br>
				These traits were key to my success in reaching a 90% overall satisfaction rating across an average of 100 cases resolved per week.

				<em>Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</em>
			</div>

			<br>
			<p>
				I seek to work for companies that are dedicated to helping individuals evolve into better versions of themselves. When I came across your platform, I was inspired by the opportunity to work with many different organizations that are providing fundamental opportunities to disenfranchised individuals.

			Amazon has amazing in-app support features that enable their support team to respond quickly and ask very few questions to resolve the user’s issue. Amazon does a phenomenal job of categorizing their products, filtering potential issues by each product, and allowing the user to choose how he or she is contacted. 
			<br><br>
			Amazon is also fair. If you haven’t used a product of theirs, the user will be awarded a refund for the months the product wasn’t used.
