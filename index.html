				While at Grovo Learning, our ARR (annual recurring revenue) and rate of customer acquisition doubled which required more specialization within our Customer Success Organization. I worked with our VP of Operations, Gray Hoffman, to create our Support function.
				<br><br>
				I can help Raisely’s Support team achieve a high customer satisfaction rating while increasing their efficiency and collaboration with the Product and Engineering teams.

				It is important to be proud of your work and who you work for. Raisely is a catalyst for organizations that are tackling critical problems like human rights violations, social welfare injustices, and the degradation of our natural environment. The opportunity to help make Raisely’s mission a reality, would fill me with the greatest sense of pride and accomplishment.

			Amazon has amazing in-app support features that enable their support team to respond quickly and ask very few questions to resolve the user’s issue. Amazon does a phenomenal jobs of categorizing their products, filtering potential issues of the product, and allowing the user to choose how he or she is contacted to delight the customer. 
			<br><br>
			Amazon is also fair. If you haven’t used a product of theirs, the user will be awarded a refund for the months the product wasn’t used.
